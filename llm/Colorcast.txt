ColorKast is a web-based application designed to help ABC Paint customers transition to a new paint numbering scheme and product line. It provides users with features such as:

Graphical color chooser: Allows intuitive color selection using a pointing device.
Color translator: Converts old paint scheme numbers to new ones.
Closest colors: Finds colors similar to a given one.

User color palette: Stores recently searched colors and uploaded images.
Administrative interface: Allows authorized users to manage paint information and user access.
Functional Requirements:

The application must be accessible via a web browser.
It should be compatible with most operating systems and require minimal hardware resources.
The color chooser requires a pointing device.
The application should be easy to use and navigate.
It should provide clear error messages and user assistance.
The administrative interface should allow authorized users to manage paint information and user access.
Non-Functional Requirements:

The application should be highly performant, with sub-second response times for color searches and updates.
It should be secure and protect user data.
The application should be adaptable, robust, and reusable.
It should be compatible with different display devices and color calibration settings.
Constraints:

The application must be web-based.
It should be usable with keyboard input only.
The application should use industry standard protocols and technologies.
Assumptions:

The application will be used in an environment that meets the specified hardware and software requirements.

Finding the nearest colors in the RGB color space will provide acceptable results for the purpose of color search.
Dependencies:

The application depends on third-party databases for paint information and color search functionality.
It requires a reliable internet connection for communication with the server.
