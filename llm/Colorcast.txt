Graphical Color Chooser: Intuitive color selection using a pointing device.
Color Translator: Converts paint numbers from the old scheme to the new scheme.
Closest Colors: Finds a specified number of colors closest to a given color.
Color Search Engine: Searches for colors based on name, number, or color value.
User Color Palette: Stores a list of recently searched colors and uploaded images for matching.
Administrative Interface: Allows authorized users to update, add, and delete paint information and manage user access.
