The system must allow users to manage devices that control temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units.
The system must have a web-ready device that allows users to interact with the system.
The system must have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and control the system.
The system must have the capability to establish an individual home web server hosted on a home computer.

Non-Functional Requirements/Constraints:

The system must be completed within 12 months of inception.
The development team will consist of five engineers.
The system will use widely used, accepted, and available hardware and software technology and standards.
The cost of Digital Home elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.) must be minimized.
The system will be tested in a simulated environment.
Major changes to the document (e.g., changes in requirements) must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
The system must require an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
