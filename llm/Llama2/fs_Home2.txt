Introduction
The document specifies the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" called DigitalHome.
DigitalHome is a home management system that allows home residents to manage their daily lives by providing a lifestyle that brings together security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications.
The system will consist of household devices, sensors and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components, and a computer system to manage the components.
Team Project Information
The team consists of five engineers, and the DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and communication support.
The development process will be specified by Digital HomeOwner Inc.
The project will employ widely used, accepted, and available hardware and software technology and standards.
The cost of DigitalHome elements should be minimized, and the development team will describe their efforts to minimize costs in the final project report.
Overall Description
The Digital Home system is a system that will allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web server or on a local home server.
The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition and is intended as a prototype for business decisions about future development of a commercial product.
The scope of the project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the use of a web-ready device.
The prototype DH software system will be situated in a simulated environment with no actual physical home and all sensors and controllers will be simulated.
