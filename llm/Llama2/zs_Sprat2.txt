The tool shall allow analysts to view elements of a goal returned by a query.
The tool shall provide a template to express goals in BNF grammar.
The tool shall support automatic multi-user analysis results comparison upon the project manager’s request.
The tool shall allow analysts to view goals associated with individual scenarios.
The tool shall allow project managers to create a new domain and assign existing documents to that domain.
The tool shall allow analysts to view the elements of a scenario in the project assigned to this analyst.
The tool shall generate a list of all scenarios that share the same attribute or sets of attributes.
The tool shall allow analysts to reuse other scenarios when specifying a scenario.
The tool shall allow analysts to view the elements of any scenario in the project.
The tool shall provide a way to extract goals data-usage information from a P3P privacy policy according to the P3P standard.
