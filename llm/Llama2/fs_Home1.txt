Introduction
The Digital Home project is a smart home management system development project for HomeOwner Inc.
The system will allow home residents to manage their daily lives by providing a lifestyle that brings together security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications.
The system will consist of household devices, sensors and controllers, communication links, and a computer system that will manage the components.

Overall description
Product Description and Scope:
The Digital Home system is a prototype system that will allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web server or on a local home server.
The system will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the use of a web-ready device.
The prototype DH software system will be situated in a simulated environment.
Users Description:
DigitalHome Users:
The general user shall be able to use the DH system capabilities to monitor and control the environment in his/her home.
The general user is familiar with the layout of his/her home and the location of sensor and control devices.
Although the general user is not familiar with the technical features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with the use of a web interface and can perform simple web operations.
DigitalHome Technician:
A DH Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining the configuration of a DH system.
A DH Technician has experience with the type of hardware, software, and web services associated with a system like the DH system.
A DH Technician will have rights beyond the DH General User, capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration of the system, and starting and stopping operation of the DH System.
