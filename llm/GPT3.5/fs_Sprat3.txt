Title: Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) - Software Requirements Specification

Summary:
The document titled "Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) - Software Requirements Specification" provides an overview of SPRAT, a tool designed to align privacy and security policies in web-based systems. The document, dated July 12, 2004, outlines the purpose, modules, and requirements of SPRAT.

Introduction:
The introduction highlights the importance of aligning requirements, policies, and functionality in web-based systems to avoid conflicts and customer mistrust. It emphasizes the need for high-level goals and scenarios to ensure completeness, readability, and conflict detection in requirements engineering.

Module Breakdown:
SPRAT consists of six main modules: User Access, Goal Specification and Management, Policy Management, Flesch Readability Index, Scenario Specification and Management, and Requirements Specification. Additional modules include Legal Compliance and Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF).

Module Requirements:
This section describes the services provided by each module. It starts with the User Access Module, which defines different access levels (Administrator, Project Manager, Analysts, and Guest) and their respective permissions and restrictions. The document then outlines functional requirements for each access level, such as creating user groups, managing privacy policies, assigning analysts to projects, and updating personal profiles.

System Requirements:
The document includes a System Requirements section that specifies the properties and constraints under which the SPRAT system must operate.
