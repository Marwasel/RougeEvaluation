Title: Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) - Software Requirements Specification Summary

Introduction:
The document introduces the SPRAT tool, which aims to address the misalignment and conflicts between security and privacy policies in web-based systems. It emphasizes the importance of high-level goals and scenarios in requirements analysis and highlights the need for a tool to assist in goal and scenario mining, reconciliation, and management.

Module Breakdown:
The SPRAT tool consists of six main modules:

User Access Module (UAM): Manages access levels and permissions for different user classes, including administrators, project managers, analysts, and guests.
Goal Specification and Management Module (GSM): Supports goal management within the tool.
Policy Management Module (PM): Supports policy management within the tool.
Flesch Readability Index Module (FRE): Calculates the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
Scenario Specification and Management Module (SSM): Supports scenario management within the tool.
Requirements Specification Module (RS): Supports the definition of system requirements.
Legal Compliance Module (LC) and Requirements-Level Access Control Analysis Framework Module (RACAF) are also mentioned.
Module Requirements:
This section outlines the services provided by each module and includes functional requirements, their descriptions, origins, and priorities. The requirements are categorized into high, medium, and low priority levels, with high priority requirements being critical for system success.

User Access Module (UAM):
The UAM defines three access levels: administrator, project manager, and analyst. Each level has specific privileges and restrictions. The functional requirements include the ability to create user groups, manage user accounts, reset passwords, and disable access for old users.
