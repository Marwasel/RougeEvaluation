Introduction:
The document highlights the importance of aligning security and privacy policies with system requirements in web-based systems. It emphasizes the need for high-level goals and scenarios to ensure completeness, readability, and conflict detection in requirements engineering. The objective is to develop a tool, SPRAT, to assist in scenario and goal mining, reconciliation, and management. The tool aims to maintain a repository of goals and scenarios derived from policies and other documents.

Module Breakdown:
SPRAT consists of six main modules:

User Access Module (UAM): Manages access levels and permissions for different user classes.
Goal Specification and Management Module (GSM): Supports goal management in the tool.
Policy Management Module (PM): Supports policy management in the tool.
Flesch Readability Index Module (FRE): Calculates the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
Scenario Specification and Management Module (SSM): Supports scenario management in the tool.
Requirements Specification Module (RS): Supports system requirements.
Module Requirements:
The document provides detailed descriptions of the functional requirements for each module. It categorizes requirements into high, medium, and low priority levels. High priority requirements are critical for system functionality, while medium priority requirements are important but not critical. Low priority requirements are desirable but not necessary for immediate implementation.

User Access Module (UAM):
The UAM defines three access levels: administrator, project manager, and analyst. Each level has specific privileges and restrictions. The administrator can create user groups, reset passwords, and disable access for old users. The project manager can manage privacy policies, assign analysts to user groups and projects, and set restrictions on guest access. Analysts have various privileges related to goal, scenario, requirement, and access control policy management. Guests have limited privileges for viewing information.

System Requirements:
The document mentions that SPRAT will support other tools and provides a brief overview of the database implementation. It also highlights the focus on implementing high and medium priority requirements for SPRAT, including the Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF).

Traceability Matrix and Document Revision:
The document includes a traceability matrix to graphically display requirements dependencies. It also outlines the version history of the document, including modification dates and changes made.

Appendix:
The appendix contains a glossary of terms used throughout the document and references used as sources.

Overall, the document presents an overview of SPRAT, its modules, and their requirements, emphasizing the importance of aligning security and privacy policies with system requirements to ensure customer trust and mitigate conflicts.
