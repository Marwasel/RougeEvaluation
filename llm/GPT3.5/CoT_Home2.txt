Summary:

The DigitalHome system, developed by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc., is a "Smart House" management system designed to enhance the daily lives of home residents. It integrates security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications aspects. The system comprises household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system for centralized management.

The DigitalHome system aims to provide users with an easy-to-use interface, allowing them to monitor and control various aspects of their home environment. The system's primary features include temperature and humidity control, security system management, appliance management, and planning/reporting capabilities.

In addition to functional requirements, the system must adhere to several non-functional requirements and constraints. Performance requirements demand real-time responsiveness and a smooth user experience. Reliability is crucial, with the system being highly available and capable of handling multiple simultaneous requests without failures. Safety regulations and standards must be followed, ensuring user and environmental well-being. Robust security measures are necessary to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats. The system should also be easy to maintain, support remote diagnostics and updates, and provide comprehensive documentation.

The DigitalHome system's development is constrained by a 12-month timeline for the prototype version. The development team consists of five engineers, following the development process specified by HomeOwner Inc. Widely used hardware, software technology, and standards are preferred for both product elements and development tools.

By fulfilling these requirements and constraints, the DigitalHome system aims to serve as a prototype for making informed business decisions regarding future commercial development of DigitalHomeOwner products and services.
