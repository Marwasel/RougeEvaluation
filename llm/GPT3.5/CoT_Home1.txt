Summary:

The DigitalHome system, developed by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc., is a "Smart House" management system designed to simplify the daily lives of home residents. It integrates security, environmental and energy management (temperature, humidity, and lighting), entertainment, and communications. The system comprises household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system for centralized management.

The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the principal features of the system. The initial version serves as a limited prototype to support business decisions regarding future commercial development. A supplementary document, the Digital Home Use Case Model, provides additional detail on the requirements. The SRS is not a comprehensive specification but a foundation for further development. It was prepared in consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.

The system's functional requirements encompass various aspects, including general requirements, thermostat control, humidistat control, security system management, appliance management, and planning/reporting capabilities. The non-functional requirements and constraints include performance, reliability, safety, security, maintenance, business rules, and user documentation. These requirements ensure efficient performance, adherence to safety and security standards, reliability, ease of maintenance, compliance with business rules, and availability of comprehensive user documentation.

Development constraints specify a timeline of twelve months for the prototype's completion, a team of five engineers, adherence to development processes, utilization of widely accepted technology and standards, cost optimization, testing in a simulated environment, and the need for approval for major document changes from the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.

Overall, the DigitalHome system aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing home environments, enabling residents to control and monitor various aspects of their homes while ensuring safety, privacy, and convenience.
