Summary:

The Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) is a software tool designed to address the misalignment and conflicts between security and privacy policies, requirements, and functionality in web-based systems. It aims to prevent customer mistrust caused by conflicting privacy statements by identifying and aligning high-level goals with operational descriptions of the system. SPRAT facilitates goal and scenario mining, reconciliation, and management processes, providing a repository for maintaining goals and scenarios derived from policies and other documents.

The tool consists of six main modules: User Access Module, Goal Specification and Management Module, Policy Management Module, Flesch Readability Index Module, Scenario Specification and Management Module, and Requirements Specification Module. These modules serve various functions, including managing user access levels and permissions, supporting goal and scenario management, policy management, calculating readability indices, and specifying system requirements.

In addition to the functional requirements, SPRAT has non-functional requirements and constraints that govern its design and implementation. These include:

Accuracy: The tool must provide accurate results and ensure the correct management and analysis of goals, scenarios, policies, and requirements.
Performance: The tool should perform efficiently, with fast response times and minimal delays in handling user interactions and data processing.
Usability: The tool should be user-friendly, allowing analysts and stakeholders to navigate and utilize its functionalities without extensive training.
Flexibility: The tool should offer customization options, enabling users to define conditions and criteria for effective goal and scenario mining and management.
Multi-user Analysis Support: The tool should support concurrent usage by multiple analysts and facilitate collaboration and comparison of goal classification results.
Security: The tool must ensure the security of sensitive data, implementing measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
Readability Analysis: SPRAT includes a module for calculating the Flesch Readability Index, enabling the assessment of policy document readability.
Requirements Traceability: The tool provides a traceability matrix to visualize dependencies and relationships between requirements.
The document also mentions constraints, such as the current implementation focus on the database, high and medium priority requirements, and the development of the Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF).

Overall, SPRAT aims to enhance the alignment, completeness, and readability of security and privacy requirements in web-based systems, providing a comprehensive tool for analysts, policy managers, and auditors.
