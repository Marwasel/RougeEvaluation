Product Description:
The Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) is a software tool developed to address the misalignment and conflicts between security and privacy policies, requirements, and functionality in web-based systems. It aims to identify high-level goals, capture scenarios, and assist analysts in the mining, reconciliation, and management processes. SPRAT maintains a repository of goals and scenarios derived from policies and other documents, ensuring traceability and supporting ongoing analysis.
