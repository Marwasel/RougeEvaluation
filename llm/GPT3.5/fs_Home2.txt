Overall Description:

Digital Home is a system for managing home devices through a web interface.
Components include household devices, sensors and controllers, communication links, and a computer system.
It is a limited prototype version for making business decisions about future commercial development.
The scope includes managing temperature, humidity, security, and power to appliances and lighting units.
The prototype will be situated in a simulated environment with no physical home.
User Descriptions:

General User: Monitors and controls the home environment, familiar with web interfaces.
Master User: Can change system configuration and has the same rights as the DH Technician.
DH Technician: Responsible for setting up and maintaining the DH system, trained in system functionality and operation.
Development Constraints:

Prototype version must be completed within twelve months.
Development team consists of five engineers.
Widely used hardware and software technology and standards should be employed.
Minimization of costs for DH elements is important.
Testing will be done in a simulated environment.
Operational Environment:

Home system requires an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
A DH System should have an individual home web server for interaction, control, storage, and user account management.
A home DH gateway device is needed for communication between the web server and devices.
