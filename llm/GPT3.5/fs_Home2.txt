Summary:

The document titled "DigitalHome Requirements Specification" outlines the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" system called DigitalHome (DH). The system aims to provide home residents with easy management of their daily lives by integrating security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications. The components of the Smart House include household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system.

The document specifies that the DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the DigitalHome Customer Need Statement and serves as a list of the system's principal features. This version of DigitalHome is a limited prototype intended for HomeOwner Inc. to make business decisions regarding future commercial development. A supplementary document, the Digital Home Use Case Model, provides additional detail and information on the requirements.

The document includes information about the team responsible for the project, their roles, and the project schedule. The development timeline spans from September 2010 to August 2011, covering various phases such as need assessment, project planning, requirements, architecture, construction cycles, system testing, acceptance testing, and postmortem analysis.

The overall description section provides a product description and scope, stating that the Digital Home system allows users to manage home environment devices through a web interface. The system is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition and will focus on managing temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units. The prototype will be situated in a simulated environment without an actual physical home.

The document further describes the users of the DigitalHome system, including general users and a designated Master user who can change system configurations. It also introduces the role of a DigitalHome Technician responsible for system setup and maintenance.

The document outlines development constraints, including the completion timeline, team size, and the use of specified development processes and technology standards. It emphasizes minimizing costs and testing the system in a simulated but realistic environment.

Lastly, the document discusses the operational environment, such as the requirement for an Internet Service Provider (ISP), the need for a home web server, a home gateway device for communication, and various sensors and controllers for temperature, humidity, security, and power monitoring.

Overall, the document serves as a specification for the development of the DigitalHome system, providing an overview of its features, user descriptions, development constraints, and operational environment requirements.
