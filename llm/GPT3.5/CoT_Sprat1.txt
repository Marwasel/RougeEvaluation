Summary:

The Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT) is a software tool designed to address the misalignment and conflicts between privacy and security policies in web-based systems. It aims to assist analysts in scenario and goal mining, reconciliation, and management processes. SPRAT provides a repository for goals and scenarios derived from policies and other documents.

The tool consists of several modules, including the User Access Module, Goal Specification and Management Module, Policy Management Module, Flesch Readability Index Module, Scenario Specification and Management Module, Requirements Specification Module, Legal Compliance Module, and Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) Module.

The functional requirements of SPRAT include support for various access levels, such as administrators, project managers, analysts, and guests. Administrators have privileges to create user groups, reset passwords, and manage access. Project managers can insert new privacy policies, while analysts and guests have their respective permissions.

In addition to the functional requirements, there are several non-functional requirements and constraints. The tool must provide accurate results, ensure efficient performance, and maintain the security of sensitive data. It should have a user-friendly interface, supporting readability and flexibility through user-defined conditions. Multi-user analysis is supported, allowing for result comparison and reconciliation. The tool should be scalable, compatible with other systems, and easy to maintain. Comprehensive documentation and requirements traceability are also required.

The development of SPRAT is subject to time and resource constraints. The focus is on implementing the database, high and medium priority requirements, and the Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF).
