Title: DigitalHome Requirements Specification - Summary

The document titled "DigitalHome Requirements Specification" outlines the necessary specifications for the development of a "Smart House" called DigitalHome (DH). The system aims to provide a comprehensive home management solution, integrating security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications.

The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) serves as a preliminary version, allowing HomeOwner Inc. to make informed decisions regarding the future commercial development of DigitalHome products and services. It is not intended as a complete specification but is complemented by the Digital Home Use Case Model, which provides additional details.

The document provides information about the team members and their roles, along with the project schedule, spanning from need assessment to postmortem analysis.

The overall description section includes a product description and scope, stating that DigitalHome enables users to manage their home environment through a web interface. The system utilizes a personal web page hosted on the DigitalHome web server or a local home server, which communicates with sensor and controller devices through a home wireless gateway.

The users of DigitalHome are categorized into general users and a designated Master user. General users can monitor and control their home environment, while the Master user has additional configuration privileges. The DigitalHome Technician is responsible for system setup, maintenance, and possesses expertise in the hardware, software, and web services associated with the DH system.

Development constraints include completing the prototype version within twelve months, a five-engineer team, adherence to the specified development process, and minimizing costs. Testing will be conducted in a simulated environment, replicating the physical properties and constraints of a real home.

The operational environment section highlights the requirement of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the need for a home web server and gateway device for communication between devices. Sensors and controllers, such as programmable thermostats, humidistats, alarm contact switches, security alarms, and power switches, are also mentioned.
