Title: DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Version 1.3

Introduction:
The document outlines the requirements for the development of "DigitalHome" (DH), a smart house management system by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc. It aims to integrate security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications to enhance daily living. The SRS serves as a preliminary version to guide business decisions for future commercial development.

Team Project Information:
The project team consists of members with various roles, including the team leader, system analyst, system architect, planning manager, quality manager, and construction engineer. The project schedule encompasses different phases, starting from the need assessment to postmortem analysis.

Overall Description:
Product Description and Scope:
The Digital Home system allows users to manage home devices through a web interface. It facilitates control over temperature, humidity, security, and power to appliances and lighting units. The project focuses on developing a prototype in a simulated environment.

Users Description:
The system targets two main user groups: DigitalHome Users and DigitalHome Technicians. DigitalHome Users can monitor and control their home environment using the DH system. They possess basic familiarity with web operations. DigitalHome Technicians are responsible for system configuration, maintenance, and possess expertise in hardware, software, and web services.

Development Constraints:
The development of the prototype must be completed within one year. The team consists of five engineers, and the established development process by HomeOwner Inc. is followed. Widely used technology and standards should be employed to minimize costs. The DH system will be tested in a simulated environment.

Operational Environment:
The DH system requires an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and enables the establishment of an individual home web server for interaction, control, storage, and user account management. A home DH gateway device is also mentioned.
