Summary:

The Digital Home system, developed by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc., is a "Smart House" management system that integrates security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications. It allows home residents to easily control and monitor their daily lives. The system consists of household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system.

The product is initially a limited prototype version, aimed at making business decisions regarding future commercial development. The Digital Home system enables users to manage temperature, humidity, security, and power to appliances and lighting units through a web interface. The prototype will be situated in a simulated environment without an actual physical home.

The functional requirements encompass various aspects such as general requirements, thermostat, humidistat, security system, appliance management, and planning/reporting requirements. These requirements define the capabilities and features of the system.

The non-functional requirements and constraints include performance, reliability, safety, security, maintenance, and business rules. The system should exhibit responsive performance, handle concurrent user requests efficiently, and have a reliable operation with quick recovery from failures. Safety measures should be in place to prevent hazards, and security mechanisms must protect user data and ensure privacy. The system should be easily maintainable, comply with relevant regulations, and be accompanied by comprehensive user documentation.

These specifications and requirements form the foundation for the development of the Digital Home system, providing a clear understanding of its purpose, functionalities, and the necessary constraints to deliver a secure, reliable, and user-friendly "Smart House" management solution.
