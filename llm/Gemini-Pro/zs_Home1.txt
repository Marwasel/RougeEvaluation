This document details the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" called DigitalHome (DH), a home management system that allows residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that brings together security, environmental and energy management, entertainment, and communications.

Key features:

Temperature control: Programmable thermostats allow users to set and monitor temperature from any location using a web-ready device.
Humidity control: Programmable humidistats allow users to set and monitor humidity levels.
Security system: Contact sensors and alarms provide security against breaches.
Appliance management: Users can turn on/off small appliances and lighting units remotely.
Planning and reporting: Users can set preset home parameters and receive monthly reports on energy usage and security events.
Technical requirements:

Wireless communication between devices and the master control unit.
Compatibility with broadband internet and HVAC systems.
High reliability with backup and recovery mechanisms.
Security measures for user authentication and information encryption.
Additional notes:

This document describes a prototype version of the DH system.
The development process will follow HomeOwner Inc. standards and best practices.
User documentation will be provided online.
