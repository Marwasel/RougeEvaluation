This document outlines the requirements for the "Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool" (SPRAT), a software tool designed to assist analysts in the process of scenario and goal mining, reconciliation, and management.

Key features of SPRAT:

User Access Management: SPRAT offers different access levels for administrators, project managers, analysts, and guests, each with specific permissions and restrictions.
Goal Specification and Management: Analysts can add, edit, delete, and classify goals based on various criteria, including policy, subject, and observability. The tool also maintains traceability links between goals and their source policies.
Scenario Specification and Management: Similar to goals, analysts can manage scenarios within the tool, including adding, editing, deleting, and associating them with relevant goals.
Policy Management: Project managers can add, edit, and delete privacy policies, assign them to domains, and manage document types.
Flesch Readability Index: SPRAT provides a way to calculate the Flesch Readability Score for policy documents.
Legal Compliance: The tool supports analysis of policies for legal compliance with regulations like HIPAA, COPPA, and GLBA.
Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF): This section defines the functional requirements that support RACAF.
Additional functionalities:

Templates for goals, scenarios, P3P statements, EPAL rules, and access control policies.
Automatic propagation of associated policy information upon deletion or replacement of a goal.
Display the context of a goal, including the actual statement from the policy in which it appeared.
Support conflict identification and resolution between requirements and privacy policies.
Allow analysts to view scenarios associated with individual scenarios.
Provide dedicated sections for P3P and EPAL within the tool.
