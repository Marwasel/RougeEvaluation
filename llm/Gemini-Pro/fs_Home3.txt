Summary of the Digital Home Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 1.3

Introduction:
This document specifies the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" called DigitalHome (DH).
The DH system will allow users to manage their home environment, including temperature, humidity, security, and appliances.
This is a prototype version for internal use by HomeOwner management.
Team Project Information:

Team members and roles are listed.
Project schedule is outlined.
Overall Description:

Product Description and Scope:
The DH system will be a prototype for managing home environment.
The prototype will focus on temperature, humidity, security, and appliance control.
The prototype will be simulated and not use actual physical devices.
Users Description:
General users will be able to use the DH system capabilities.
A Master user will be designated to configure the system.
A DH Technician will be responsible for setting up and maintaining the system.
Development Constraints:

The prototype must be completed within 12 months.
The development team will consist of five engineers.
The development process specified by HomeOwner Inc. will be used.
Widely used and accepted hardware and software will be employed.
Costs of DH elements should be minimized.
The DH system will be tested in a simulated environment.
Major changes to this document must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
Operational Environment:

The DH system will require an Internet Service Provider.
A DH Home Web Server will be used for interaction with the DH elements.
A DH Gateway Device will communicate with all DH devices and connect to the Internet.
Sensors and controllers will be used to monitor and control the home environment.
Functional Requirements:

The DH system will allow users to control their home environment from any location.
Users will be able to monitor and control temperature, humidity, security, and appliances.
The system will support Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature values.
The system will be compatible with centralized HVAC systems.
The system will be able to manage up to 50 door and window contact sensors.
The system will be able to manage up to 100 power switches for appliances and lighting.
The DH Planner will allow users to set preset home parameters for certain time periods.
The system will provide monthly reports on the management and control of the home.
Other Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance requirements:
Displays of environmental conditions will be updated at least every two seconds.
Sensor data acquisition rate will be at least 10 Hz.
Reliability requirements:
The DH System must be highly reliable with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.
The DH System will incorporate backup and recovery mechanisms.
All DH operations will incorporate exception handling.
Safety requirements:
High system reliability is important to ensure safety of home dwellers.
Security requirements:
A DH user account will be established upon installation.
The DH web system will provide for authentication and information encryption.
Maintenance requirements:
The development of the DH system will use methods and techniques to support system maintenance.
All modules and components will be designed and implemented for potential incorporation in a commercial version.
Business rules:
All system documents will be up-to-date and reside in the HomeOwner Document Archive.
Object-oriented development using UML 2.0 is the preferred method.
User documentation:
The DH System will provide users with online documentation.
