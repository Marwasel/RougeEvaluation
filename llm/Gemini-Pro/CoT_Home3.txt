Product Description
The DigitalHome (DH) system is a prototype "Smart House" system that allows users to manage their home environment and devices remotely via a web interface. The system includes:

Temperature control: Programmable thermostats allow users to set and monitor temperature in different rooms, with individual or collective control and scheduling options.
Humidity control: Programmable humidistats allow users to set and monitor humidity levels in different rooms, with individual or collective control and scheduling options.
Security system: Contact sensors and alarms provide security monitoring and alerts for potential breaches.
Appliance management: Users can remotely control power switches for small appliances and lighting units, turning them on or off as desired.
Planning and reporting: The DH Planner allows users to set preset home parameters for specific time periods, while the system provides monthly reports on temperature, humidity, security breaches, and periods of system inactivity.
Functional Requirements
Users can monitor and control temperature, humidity, security, and appliances from any location using a web-ready device.
The system communicates through a home web server and a master control device (DH Gateway Device) that connects to the home's broadband internet and uses wireless communication to interact with home devices.
Wireless communication allows for sensor readings and controller values to be sent and received.
The system supports Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature values.
The system adheres to ASHRAE standards for centralized HVAC systems.
Users can manage up to 50 door and window contact sensors and multiple security alarms.
Users can manage up to 100 power switches for small appliances and lighting units.
The system provides information about the state of power switches and allows users to change their state.
Non-Functional Requirements and Constraints
Performance:

Environmental conditions are updated at least every two seconds.
Sensors have a minimum data acquisition rate of 10 Hz.
Environmental sensors and controllers must be within 1000 feet of the master control device.
Reliability:

The system must have high reliability with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.
The system incorporates backup and recovery mechanisms for system data.
Exception handling provides clear messages to users in case of errors or exceptional conditions.
Safety:

High system reliability is crucial to ensure no system failures occur while carrying out user requests, which could affect the safety of home dwellers.
Security:

User accounts require authentication and information encryption through a reliable security technology like Transport Layer Security.
Login requires an account name and password.
Maintenance:

Development methods and techniques support system maintenance, including documentation and adherence to standards.
Prototype modules and components are designed for potential incorporation in a commercial version of the DigitalHome System.
Business Rules:

All system documents must be up-to-date, use the Homeowner document format, and reside in the HomeOwner Document Archive at project completion.
Object-oriented development using UML 2.0 is the preferred method for HomeOwner product software development.
User Documentation:

Online documentation includes FAQs, information on parameter settings and sensor readings, and instructions for using the DH Planner.
