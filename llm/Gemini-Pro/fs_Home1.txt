Digital Home Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Summary
This document outlines the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" system called DigitalHome (DH) by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc. The system allows users to manage their home's environment (temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units) through a web interface.

Key Features:

Thermostat Control: Users can monitor and control temperature in different rooms using programmable thermostats.
Humidistat Control: Users can monitor and control humidity levels in different rooms using programmable humidistats.
Security System: Contact sensors and security alarms provide protection against unauthorized entry.
Appliance Management: Users can turn on/off small appliances and lighting units using programmable power switches.
Planning and Reporting: Users can create monthly plans to set environmental parameters for different time periods and access reports on past usage.
Target Audience:

Homeowners who want to manage their home's environment remotely.
Businesses looking to develop smart home products.
Development Constraints:

Prototype version to be completed within 12 months.
Development team consists of 5 engineers.
Use widely available hardware and software.
Minimize development costs.
System will be tested in a simulated environment.
Technical Requirements:

System requires an internet connection (cable modem or DSL).
Uses a home web server to interact with DH elements and store data.
Uses a DH Gateway device to communicate with sensors and controllers.
Uses wireless communication to connect with sensors and controllers.
Requires various environmental controllers and sensors (thermostats, humidistats, contact sensors, security alarms, and power switches).
Non-Functional Requirements:

High reliability with minimal failures.
Backup and recovery mechanisms.
Exception handling for errors and exceptional conditions.
Secure user authentication and information encryption.
Easy system maintenance.
User documentation available online.
