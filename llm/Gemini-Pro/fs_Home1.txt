Overview:

This document specifies the requirements for developing a "Smart House" system called DigitalHome (DH). The DH system allows home residents to manage their daily lives by controlling their home environment (temperature, humidity, security, lighting, and appliances) through a web interface. This initial version is a limited prototype for business decision-making about future commercial development.

Key Features:

Temperature control: Programmable thermostats allow users to set and monitor temperatures in different rooms.
Humidity control: Programmable humidistats allow users to set and monitor humidity levels.
Security system: Contact sensors and alarms provide security monitoring and breach notifications.
Appliance management: Users can control power to small appliances and lighting units.
Planning and reporting: Users can set daily and monthly schedules for various parameters and access historical reports.
Technical Details:

The system uses wireless communication between sensors, controllers, and the master control unit (DH Gateway Device).
The DH Gateway Device connects to the home's broadband internet connection.
The system utilizes web-based interfaces for user interaction and control.
The prototype DH software system will be situated in a simulated environment.
Target Users:

General users with basic web experience and familiarity with their home layout.
Master users with additional privileges for configuration and user account management.
DH Technicians responsible for system setup, maintenance, and configuration changes.
Constraints:

The prototype version must be completed within 12 months.
The development team consists of five engineers.
The project will use widely available and accepted hardware and software technology and standards.
The cost of DH elements should be minimized.
The system will be tested in a simulated environment.
Major changes to this document require approval from the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
Additional Notes:

The document references a supplementary document, the Digital Home Use Case Model, for additional details.
The system should be compatible with a centralized HVAC system.
The system incorporates backup and recovery mechanisms.
The system utilizes security features like Transport Layer Security for user authentication and information encryption.
The system adheres to HomeOwner document format and coding standards.
User documentation is provided online, including FAQs, parameter setting explanations, and DH Planner instructions.
