Purpose: This document outlines the requirements for the SPRAT software tool, which is designed to assist analysts in the scenario and goal mining, reconciliation, and management processes.

Key Features:

User Access Module: Manages access levels and permissions for different user groups (administrator, project manager, analyst, guest).
Goal Specification and Management Module: Supports goal management, including adding, deleting, updating, and classifying goals.
Policy Management Module: Supports policy management, including adding, deleting, and updating policies.
Flesch Readability Index Module: Calculates the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
Scenario Specification and Management Module: Supports scenario management, including adding, deleting, and updating scenarios.
Requirements Specification Module: Supports the requirements for a system.
Legal Compliance: Ensures compliance with relevant legal requirements.
Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) module: Defines the functional requirements that support RACAF.
Target Users:

Requirements engineers
Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs)
Policy analysts
Auditors
Priority Levels:

High: Critical requirements that must be satisfied for the system to function properly.
Medium: Important requirements that are desirable but not critical.
Low: Desirable but not necessary requirements that can be postponed for implementation in later versions.
Key Requirements:

FR-UA 1: The system shall support an administrator level with specific privileges.
FR-UA 2: The system shall support a project manager level with specific privileges.
FR-UA 3: The system shall support an analyst level with specific privileges.
FR-UA 4: The system shall support a guest level with specific privileges.
FR-GSM 1: The system shall allow analysts to add a new goal.
FR-GSM 2: The system shall provide templates for goals, scenarios, P3P statements, EPAL rules, and access control policies.
FR-GSM 3: The system shall allow analysts to classify goals.
FR-GSM 4: The system shall allow multiple subject classifications for each goal.
FR-GSM 5: The system shall provide the ability to dynamically add a new classification type of goals to the tool.
FR-GSM 6: The system shall allow the analysts to request a new classification type of goals and also allow the project manager to create that classification type.
FR-GSM 7: The system shall provide the ability to update an existing goal.
FR-GSM 8: The system shall provide the ability to delete a goal.
FR-GSM 9: The system shall provide the ability to automatically propagate associated policy information upon deletion or replacement of a goal.
FR-GSM 10: The system shall maintain traceability links between a goal and the policy from which the goal was derived.
FR-GSM 11: The system shall provide the ability to display the number of occurrences of a goal in a policy, in multiple policies, and within a domain.
FR-GSM 12: The system shall provide the ability to display the number of different goals that occur in a policy.
FR-GSM 13: The system shall display the context of a goal.
FR-GSM 14: The system shall allow analysts to create and update goal keyword definitions and allow guests to view keyword definitions.
FR-GSM 15: The system shall provide the ability to lock and unlock the keyword definition by either the project manager or the first person who created the definition in the repository.
FR-GSM 16: The system shall allow analysts and guests to search goals according to analyst chosen attributes.
FR-GSM 17: The system shall allow analysts to view elements of a goal returned by a query.
FR-GSM 18: The system shall provide a template to express goals in BNF grammar.
FR-GSM 19: The system shall support conflict identification and resolution.
FR-GSM 20: The system shall allow analysts to view scenarios associated with individual scenarios.
FR-GSM 21: The system shall provide a P3P dedicated section in the tool.
FR-GSM 22: The system shall provide an EPAL dedicated section in the tool.
FR-ADM 1: The system shall allow project managers to add analysis documents and assign a domain to each document.
FR-ADM 2: The system shall allow project managers to edit the domain for the documents.
FR-ADM 3: The system shall allow project managers to delete the domain for the documents.
FR-ADM 4: The system shall allow project managers to create document types.
FR-ADM 5: The system shall provide the ability to display document names and links to the actual document text within a specific domain in an alphabetical order.
FR-ADM 6: The system shall allow project managers to create a new domain and assign existing documents to this domain.
FR-ADM 7: The system shall support automatic multi-user analysis results comparison upon the project managerâ€™s request.
FR-FRE 1: The system shall provide a way to calculate the Flesch Readability for textual documents.
