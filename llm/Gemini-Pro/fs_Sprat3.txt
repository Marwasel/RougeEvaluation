Summary of "2004 - sprat.pdf"
This document outlines the requirements for a software tool called SPRAT, which stands for Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool. SPRAT is designed to assist analysts in the process of identifying, managing, and analyzing goals and scenarios related to privacy policies. The document details the various modules that will comprise SPRAT, the functionalities each module will provide, and the requirements that must be met for each functionality.

Key features of SPRAT:

User Access Module (UAM): Manages access levels and permissions for different user classes (administrator, project manager, analyst, guest).
Goal Specification and Management Module (GSM): Supports goal management, including creation, editing, deletion, classification, and traceability.
Policy Management Module: Supports policy management within the tool.
Flesch Readability Index Module: Calculates the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
Scenario Specification and Management Module: Supports scenario management within the tool.
Requirements Specification Module: Supports requirements for a system.
Legal Compliance Module: Ensures compliance with legal requirements.
Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF) Module: Supports functionalities related to RACAF.
Requirements are categorized based on priority:

High: Critical requirements that must be satisfied for the system to function properly.
Medium: Important requirements that are desirable but not critical.
Low: Desirable but not critical requirements that can be postponed for later implementation.
The document also outlines non-functional requirements (NFRs) focusing on data security and user authentication.

Additionally, the document includes information on:

Templates for goals, scenarios, P3P statements, EPAL rules, and access control policies.
Automatic propagation of associated policy information upon deletion or replacement of a goal.
Traceability links between goals and the policies from which they were derived.
Displaying the number of occurrences of a goal in a policy, across multiple policies, and within a domain.
Displaying the number of different goals that occur in a policy.
Displaying the context of a goal.
Creating and updating goal keyword definitions.
Locking and unlocking keyword definitions.
Searching goals according to analyst-chosen attributes.
Viewing elements of a goal returned by a query.
Providing a template to express goals in BNF grammar.
Supporting conflict identification and resolution.
Viewing scenarios associated with individual scenarios.
Providing dedicated sections for P3P and EPAL.
Document management for analysis documents (e.g., policy documents).
Automatic multi-user analysis results comparison.
Calculation of the Flesch Readability Index for policy documents.
