This document outlines the requirements for the Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis Tool (SPRAT), a software tool designed to assist analysts in the process of goal and scenario mining, reconciliation, and management.

Key features of SPRAT include:

User Access Module: Manages access levels and permissions for different user classes (administrator, project manager, analyst, guest).
Goal Specification and Management Module: Supports goal management, including adding, updating, deleting, and classifying goals.
Policy Management Module: Supports policy management, including adding, deleting, and editing policies.
Flesch Readability Index Module: Calculates the Flesch Readability Index of policy documents.
Scenario Specification and Management Module: Supports scenario management, including adding, updating, deleting, and classifying scenarios.
Requirements Specification Module: Supports the requirements for a system.
Legal Compliance: Ensures compliance with relevant legal requirements.
Requirements-level Access Control Analysis Framework (RACAF): Supports functional requirements for RACAF.
SPRAT will provide several benefits, including:

Improved efficiency: Automates tasks such as goal and scenario identification, reconciliation, and management.
Enhanced accuracy: Reduces errors associated with manual analysis.
Increased consistency: Ensures consistency in the analysis process.
Improved communication: Facilitates communication among stakeholders.
Priority levels have been assigned to each requirement based on discussions with stakeholders:

High: Critical requirements that must be satisfied for the system to function properly.
Medium: Important requirements that are desirable but not critical.
Low: Desirable requirements that can be postponed for later versions of the system.
The document also includes:

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) that specify the properties the system must satisfy.
Security and privacy requirements (SPRs) that ensure the security of sensitive data.
A requirements traceability matrix that graphically displays dependencies between requirements.
A document revision history that outlines the version of the current document, the people responsible for the document, dates the document is modified, and the changes made to the document.
A glossary of terms used throughout the document.
A bibliography of the references used in the document.
