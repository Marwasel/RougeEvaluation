Description:

This document specifies the requirements for the development of a "Smart House" called DigitalHome (DH).
DH will allow residents to manage daily lives by providing security, environmental management (temperature, humidity, lighting), entertainment, and communications.
DH components consist of household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system for management.
This initial prototype version will be used by HomeOwner management to make business decisions about future commercial development of DigitalHome products.

2. Functional Requirements:
DH will allow users to control temperature, humidity, lights, security, and small appliances from anywhere using a web-ready device.
DH will use a home web server to communicate and control home devices and systems.
A master control unit (DH Gateway Device) connects to the home's broadband internet and uses wireless communication to send and receive signals between the DH system and home devices.
Up to eight thermostats and humidistats can be placed throughout the home for individual or collective control.
DH can manage up to fifty door and window contact sensors and activate security alarms.
DH can manage up to one hundred 115-volt, 10-amp power switches for small appliances and lighting.
DH Planner allows users to set preset home parameters for specific time periods.

3. Non-functional Requirements and Constraints:
DH must be highly reliable with no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation.
DH will incorporate backup and recovery mechanisms to restore system data in case of failure.
DH will use Transport Layer Security for authentication and information encryption.
DH development must use methods and techniques to support maintenance, including documentation, abstraction, module independence, and adherence to IEEE standards and HomeOwner coding standards.
All system documents must be up-to-date and use the Homeowner document format.
DH will use object-oriented development using UML 2.0.
DH will provide online user documentation, including FAQs, parameter setting explanations, and DH Planner instructions.

Constraints:
The prototype version must be completed within twelve months.
The development team will consist of five engineers.
Widely used, accepted, and available hardware and software technologies and standards should be employed where possible.
The cost of DH elements should be minimized.
DH will be tested in a simulated environment.
Major changes to this document must be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
