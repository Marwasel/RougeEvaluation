Functional Requirements:
The DigitalHome system offers a wide range of functionalities to manage and control various aspects of a home environment. These functionalities can be broadly categorized into five main areas:

1. Temperature Control:

Users can monitor and adjust the temperature in their homes remotely using web-ready devices like computers, cell phones, or PDAs.
The system allows for individual or collective control of up to eight thermostats placed in different rooms, enabling customized temperature settings for different areas.
Each thermostat can be programmed with up to 24 one-hour settings per day for every day of the week, providing flexibility and automation.
The system supports both Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales for user convenience.
Compatibility with various HVAC systems (gas, oil, electricity, solar, or combinations) ensures wide applicability.
Adherence to ASHRAE standards ensures safety and efficiency in temperature control.
2. Humidity Control:

Similar to temperature control, users can monitor and adjust humidity levels in their homes remotely using web-ready devices.
The system allows for individual control of up to eight humidistats placed in different rooms, enabling customized humidity settings for different areas.
Each humidistat can be programmed with up to 24 one-hour settings per day for every day of the week, providing flexibility and automation.
The system supports setting humidity levels between 30% and 60%, with 1% increments, allowing for precise control.
Wireless communication with the humidistats ensures a clean and efficient setup.
3. Security System:

The DigitalHome security system consists of contact sensors and alarms to protect the home from unauthorized access.
The system can manage up to 50 door and window contact sensors, providing comprehensive coverage of entry points.
Both light and sound alarms are available, offering multiple layers of security.
The system activates the alarms when a security breach occurs, such as a contact sensor being set to "OPEN."
4. Appliance Management:

The DigitalHome system allows users to manage and control small appliances and lighting units in their homes remotely.
The system can manage up to 100 power switches, enabling control over a wide range of appliances.
Users can receive information about the state of a power switch (ON or OFF), providing real-time awareness of appliance status.
The system can change the state of a power switch, allowing users to turn appliances on or off remotely.
Manual overrides are available, allowing users to temporarily adjust appliance states as needed.
5. Planning and Reporting:

The DigitalHome Planner provides users with the ability to set various preset home parameters for specific time periods.
Users can create or modify monthly plans that specify temperature, humidity, contact sensor, and power switch settings for each day and up to four daily time periods.
Planned parameter values can be overridden through the website or manually on household devices, offering flexibility and control.
The system generates monthly reports on home management and control, providing insights into environmental conditions, security breaches, and system operation.
These reports include daily average, maximum, and minimum values for temperature and humidity, as well as timestamps for security breaches and system downtime.
Non-Functional Requirements:
The DigitalHome system is designed to meet specific non-functional requirements that ensure its performance, reliability, safety, security, and maintainability.

1. Performance:

Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, contact sensors, and power switches) are displayed with a minimum update rate of every two seconds, ensuring real-time responsiveness.
Sensor data acquisition occurs at a minimum rate of 10 Hz, providing accurate and timely information.
Environmental sensors and controllers must be within 1000 feet of the master control device for effective communication.
2. Reliability:

The DigitalHome system boasts high reliability with a failure rate of no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation, ensuring consistent performance.
Backup and recovery mechanisms are incorporated to ensure data integrity and system resilience.
Daily backups of all system data are performed, with the backup time set by the DH Technician during system setup.
In case of system failure, the recovery mechanism restores system data from the most recent backup, minimizing downtime and data loss.
Exception handling is implemented to provide clear and descriptive messages to users in case of errors or exceptional conditions, ensuring transparency and user-friendliness.
3. Safety:

While specific safety requirements are not outlined, the system's high reliability is crucial to ensure the safety of home dwellers.
System failures could potentially affect safety by compromising security, lighting, temperature, humidity, and appliance control.
4. Security:

User accounts are established upon installation, and the system employs Transport Layer Security for authentication and information encryption, ensuring data protection.
Login to an account requires both a username and a password, providing two-factor authentication for enhanced security.
5. Maintenance:

The system is developed using methods and techniques that support easy maintenance, including documentation of requirements, design, and code.
Abstraction, information hiding, and module independence in system design promote modularity and maintainability.
Adherence to IEEE standards and the HomeOwner Coding Standard ensures consistency and compatibility with industry best practices.
All modules and components are designed for potential incorporation into a fully specified commercial version of the DigitalHome System, ensuring future scalability and adaptability.
