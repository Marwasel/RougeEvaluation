DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification Summary
Introduction:

This document specifies the requirements for the development of a prototype "Smart House" called DigitalHome (DH) by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of HomeOwner Inc. The DH system allows residents to manage daily life by providing security, environmental management (temperature, humidity, and lighting), entertainment, and communications. The system consists of household devices, sensors, controllers, communication links, and a computer system.

Team Project Information:

Team members and roles are listed.
Project schedule is outlined.
Overall Description:

Product Description and Scope: The DH system will be a prototype used by HomeOwner management to make business decisions about future commercial development. The scope is limited to managing temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units through a web-ready device.
Users Description: The DH system is intended for general users familiar with web interfaces and their home layout. A Master user can change system configuration. A DH Technician sets up and maintains the system.
Development Constraints: The prototype must be completed within twelve months, with a five-person development team. The HomeOwner development process will be used. Widely used technologies and standards should be employed. The cost of DH elements should be minimized. The system will be tested in a simulated environment.
Operational Environment: The DH system requires an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and a DH Home Web Server. The system will include a Gateway Device, thermostats, humidistats, magnetic alarm contact switches, security alarms, and digital programmable power switches.
Functional Requirements:

The DH system allows control of temperature, humidity, lights, security, and small appliances from any location using a web-ready device.
The system uses wireless communication to send and receive data between the DH system and home devices.
The system supports Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature values.
The system is compatible with centralized HVAC systems.
Up to eight thermostats and humidistats can be used.
Up to fifty door and window contact sensors can be managed.
Up to one hundred 115-volt, 10-amp power switches can be managed.
The DH Planner allows users to set preset home parameters for specific time periods.
The system provides monthly reports on environmental conditions, security breaches, and system operation.
Other Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance requirements include display updates every two seconds, sensor data acquisition rate of 10 Hz, and a communication range of 1000 feet.
Reliability requirements include a failure rate of no more than 1 failure per 10,000 hours of operation and backup and recovery mechanisms.
Safety requirements emphasize high system reliability to avoid failures that could affect home dwellers' safety.
Security requirements include user account authentication and information encryption.
Maintenance requirements include documentation, use of abstraction and module independence, and adherence to IEEE standards and HomeOwner Coding Standard.
Business rules specify document format, object-oriented development, and user documentation.
